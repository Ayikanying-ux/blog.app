# blog.app
My blog app

My first fully pledge web app in django

To open it on browser, first create a virtual environment with the command python -m venv (name of the virtual env)

Then cd in the venv created and then cd into the Scripts folder and install django

Then transfer the project into the Scripts folder and the run it on your local machine
